The simulation starts from time 0.0. At this time the velocity field in the fluid domain is not developed. 
1. Set the number of OpenFOAM processes in the decomposeParDict dictionary. 
2. Run decomposeParDict. 
3. First run the fluid solver icoFoamYade with the coupling disabled, (this can be done in the icoFoamYade.C file, commenting all lines starting with `yadecoupling'
and compiling icoFoamYade.C using wmake). 
4. Run the coupled simulation : modify icoFoamYade.C file, uncomment the lines starting with `yadecoupling'. wmake. 
5. Run the simulation : mpiexec -n 1 python scriptYade.py : -n numprocs icoFoamYade -parallel, where numprocs is the number of processors
set in the decomposeParDict.
